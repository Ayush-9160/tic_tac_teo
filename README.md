# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe written in C++.

## How to Play

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Players take turns to input their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
4. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (tie).

## Rules

- Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all spaces on the board are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Compile

You can compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, if you're using g++, you can compile the code with the following command:
